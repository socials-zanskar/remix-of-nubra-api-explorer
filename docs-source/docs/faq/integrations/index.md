## Language & SDK Support

??? faq-question "How can I integrate Nubra’s data into Python, Node.js, or C#?"
    Nubra APIs are language-agnostic.

    You can use:

    - **Python SDK** (recommended — fastest, easiest)
    - **Native REST APIs** in Node.js, C#, Go, Java, or any language that supports HTTPS
    - **WebSockets** for real-time streaming (indices, options, orderbook, full market feed)

    Code examples for Python are provided in the SDK; REST samples can be adapted in any language.

??? faq-question "Is there a Postman collection or code samples available?"
    Yes — Nubra provides **ready-to-use code samples** for every major API category (Market Data, Trading, Option Chain, WebSockets, Portfolio, etc.) directly inside the official documentation.

    You can find all examples in multiple languages (Python SDK, cURL, REST samples) at:

    👉 **https://nubra.io/products/api/docs/**

    A dedicated Postman collection is in progress and will be added soon.  
    For now, all REST endpoints in the docs include request/response schemas that can be copied directly into Postman or any API client.

## Trading Platform & Third-Party Integrations

??? faq-question "How do I connect my API app to a third-party trading platform?"
    Every third-party platform ultimately connects to Nubra APIs using **your authentication token + REST/WebSocket calls**.

    Typical setup flow:

    1. Your trading platform sends signals (webhooks / API triggers)  
    2. Your backend receives them  
    3. Your backend calls Nubra's **Trading API (V2)** → place/modify/cancel  
    4. WebSocket feeds update your local system with fills, market data, and portfolio changes  

    If you need static IP whitelisting for automated systems, add your primary/secondary IP under:

    **Account Settings → API Credentials → Update Static IP**

    ### How to Connect Nubra on Tradetron

    Inside **Tradetron → Brokers → Add Broker → Nubra**:

    1. Select **Nubra**
    2. Enter **registered phone number**
    3. Enter **MPIN**
    4. Click **Generate OTP**

    ## AlgoTest Integration – Coming Soon

    Nubra ↔ AlgoTest integration is under development.

    Once ready, you will be able to:

    - Link Nubra trading account in AlgoTest  
    - Execute live or paper strategies  
    - Connect option strategy engines  
    - Use AlgoTest analytics with Nubra execution

??? faq-question "Can I connect Nubra APIs to platforms like TradingView, Excel, or Amibroker?"
    Nubra does **not** provide native plugins/connectors for:

    - TradingView  
    - Excel  
    - Amibroker  
    - MT5 / MT4  
    - NinjaTrader  
    - AmiBroker AFL  

    However, you *can* integrate Nubra with these platforms by building a **custom bridge** using REST or WebSocket APIs.

    Typical integration methods:

    - Python/Node.js middleware for TradingView alerts  
    - Excel integration via Office Scripts / Python / VBA  
    - Amibroker plugin using AFL extensions  
    - Custom charting using WebSocket streaming feed  

    Nubra’s APIs are fully capable; some scripting is needed.
