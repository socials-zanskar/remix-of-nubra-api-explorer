Algo trading in India has matured rapidly, but the **choice of API infrastructure** still defines how scalable, automated, and reliable your trading system can become.

For most retail traders, the default choice has traditionally been **Zerodha’s Kite Connect API**.  
But newer platforms like **Nubra API** are challenging that norm by rethinking **authentication, market data, and execution** from the ground up.

This blog breaks down the **real-world differences** between Nubra API and Zerodha API — not from documentation, but from the perspective of someone actually building and deploying algo systems.

## Authentication: How Each Platform Lets You In

  ### Zerodha Kite Connect Authentication

  ![Zerodha Authentication](./assets/ZerodhaAuthenticationGIF.gif)

  When you build live trading systems, the **first bottleneck isn’t latency — it’s login**.

  Zerodha’s Kite Connect follows a **manual authentication loop**:
  1. Open a browser
  2. Log in manually
  3. Complete 2FA / OTP
  4. Capture redirect URL
  5. Generate a request token

  This token **expires daily**, meaning:
  - A human must log in every morning
  - Headless server deployments are fragile
  - Fully automated systems break without intervention

  </div>

  ### Nubra Authentication

  ![Nubra Authentication](./assets/NubraAuthenticationGIF.gif)

  Nubra skips the browser entirely.  
  Authentication happens **directly inside your code** using the SDK:

  ```python
  from nubra_python_sdk.start_sdk import InitNubraSdk, NubraEnv

  # Initialize the Nubra SDK client
  nubra = InitNubraSdk(NubraEnv.PROD)
  ```

  For developers running algos on VPS or servers, Nubra also supports TOTP-based login — meaning you can generate a time-based authentication code once, store credentials in a .env file, and run fully automated logins without any human input.

## WebSocket Data Structure

<div style="display: flex; gap: 32px; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">

  <!-- Zerodha Column -->
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 320px;">

  ### Zerodha WebSocket Tick Stream

  **Zerodha’s WebSocket streams raw exchange-level tick data** — exactly as received from the exchange.

  This data requires **preprocessing, symbol mapping, and cleanup** before it can be used in a trading model.

  Developers must then write **separate code modules** to calculate analytics like:
  - Implied Volatility (IV)
  - Delta
  - Theta
  - Vega

  This makes the overall workflow **slower and more complex**.

  **Zerodha Tick Stream Example:**

  ```python
  {
      'tradable': True,
      'instrument_token': 12212994,
      'last_price': 398.65,
      'volume_traded': 7404225,
      'ohlc': {
          'open': 288.05,
          'high': 419.7,
          'low': 230.15,
          'close': 302.95
      },
      'oi': 1303275,
      'depth': {
          'buy': [
              {'quantity': 375, 'price': 397.25},
              ...
          ],
          'sell': [
              {'quantity': 300, 'price': 398.05},
              ...
          ]
      }
  }
  ```

  </div>

  ### Nubra WebSocket (Analytics-Enriched Stream)

  **Nubra delivers tick-level data enriched with analytics.**

  Its WebSocket stream includes:
  - Live option Greeks
  - Order book details
  - Market depth

  All delivered as **structured, ready-to-use Python objects**.

  This removes the need for additional preprocessing or analytical computation, letting developers focus entirely on **strategy logic and execution**.

  **Nubra (Options Greeks) Stream Example:**

  ```python
  OptionData(
      ref_id=942993,
      strike_price=2350000,
      lot_size=75,
      last_traded_price=242935,
      delta=0.9967,
      gamma=4.97e-05,
      theta=-0.7176,
      vega=0.2772,
      open_interest=0,
      volume=1275
  )
  ```

## Strategy Execution

  <!-- Strategy Description -->
  <div style="flex: 2; min-width: 320px;">

  ### “Delta-Neutral Short Strangle: Two Paths, One Strategy”

  A **delta-neutral short strangle** involves selling one out-of-the-money call and one out-of-the-money put such that the combined delta of both legs is approximately zero.

  This strategy profits from **time decay (positive Theta)** and benefits when **implied volatility (IV) drops**.  
  While the concept is simple, implementation complexity varies dramatically depending on the platform you use.

  Let’s see how the same strategy looks when built on **Zerodha’s Kite Connect** vs **Nubra’s SDK**.

  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 340px;">

  ### Strategy Deployment on Zerodha

  ![Zerodha Strategy Execution](./assets/6.png)

  **Zerodha (Kite Connect): Manual Multi-Leg Execution**

  - Operates at a **per-leg level** — each option leg (Call, Put, Stop-Loss) requires a separate REST API call.
  - Tick data from WebSocket arrives **raw and unstructured**, requiring preprocessing and cleaning before analytics.
  - **Greeks and implied volatility must be calculated manually** using external code or libraries.
  - Strike selection for a short strangle depends on these **custom-computed Greeks**.
  - Execution is **sequential** — each order (sell, stop-loss, target) is placed and confirmed independently.
  - Requires **constant monitoring** of each leg’s PnL and delta exposure.
  - Exit logic such as **OCO (One Cancels Other)** or combined target/stop-loss handling must be manually coded.

  This modular setup offers flexibility but adds **latency, execution risk, and infrastructure complexity**.

  ### Strategy Deployment on Nubra

  ![Nubra Strategy Execution](./assets/7.png)

  **Nubra (Flexi Basket SDK): Unified Multi-Leg Execution**

  - Treats the entire strategy as **one basket**, not individual legs.
  - Uses a **single Flexi Basket Order** to execute multiple legs (call + put) in one atomic transaction.
  - All parameters — **entry price, stop-loss, and target** — are defined at the **basket level**, not per order.
  - Built-in **OCO logic and risk management** automatically handle exits and cancellations.
  - Streams **real-time analytics** (Greeks, IV, deltas) directly via the SDK — no preprocessing needed.
  - All legs update **in real time within the basket**; PnL and risk are tracked collectively.
  - Reduces API load and latency by **eliminating redundant API calls**.

  This architecture minimizes latency, removes operational overhead, and lets traders focus purely on **strategy design and logic**.

## Final Thoughts: Choosing the Right Foundation for Algo Trading

<div style="margin-bottom: 24px;">

![Latency and Infrastructure Comparison](./assets/ComparisonTable.png)

</div>

Most algo traders eventually face the same crossroad — **balancing flexibility with speed**.

**Zerodha’s Kite Connect** gives developers full control over every layer of the stack, but at the cost of:
- Manual authentication flows
- Multiple sequential API calls
- Raw data preprocessing
- Higher latency and operational overhead  

It’s a powerful choice for traders who want to **construct their entire infrastructure from scratch** — from data cleaning and analytics to execution logic.

---

**Nubra**, in contrast, brings **institutional-grade latency and efficiency** to retail algo developers.

Its SDK merges:
- Authentication  
- Market data  
- Live analytics  
- Multi-leg execution  

into a **single, real-time framework**.

With built-in Greeks, live option analytics, and **atomic basket execution**, Nubra removes the layers of friction between **strategy design and trade execution** — allowing developers to focus on what actually matters:

> **Building intelligent trading systems, not maintaining infrastructure.**

*The real decision isn’t about APIs.*  
It’s about whether you want to **engineer plumbing** — or **engineer alpha**.
