*A Practical Guide for Brokers, Fintechs, and Algo Traders*

Algorithmic trading in India has entered a **formal regulatory phase**.  
With the rollout of SEBI’s retail algo framework and exchange implementation standards, **API-based trading is no longer just a technical integration — it is a regulated activity**.

This guide distills the **most operationally relevant rules** around API trading, algo approvals, OPS limits, tagging, and broker responsibilities.

## Algo Registration Process (High-Level Flow)

![SEBI Algo Registration Process](./assets/AlgoRegistration.png)

> **Key Idea**  
> If a retail order is automated **and** sent via API, it is treated as an **algorithmic order** and must follow this framework.

---

## Why SEBI Regulated API-Based Trading

SEBI observed that:

- Retail traders increasingly used APIs and automation  
- Algo activity occurred **without uniform disclosure**
- Risk controls varied significantly across brokers and platforms  

To address this, SEBI mandated that:

> **All API orders are treated as algorithmic orders**  
> **Algo strategies must be classified, registered, and monitored**  
> **Brokers remain fully responsible for client orders**

## White Box vs Black Box Algos

Retail algos are categorised as White Box or Black Box depending on whether the trading logic is disclosed and replicable.

### 🟦 White Box Algos
*Logic is disclosed and replicable*

**Examples**
- TWAP
- VWAP
- Execution-only strategies

**Mandatory Requirements**
- Strategy write-up
- RMS explanation
- Auditor certificate

</div>

<div style="flex:1; border:1px solid #ef4444; border-radius:8px; padding:16px;">

### 🟥 Black Box Algos
*Logic is not disclosed and not replicable*

**Examples**
- Arbitrage strategies
- Alpha-seeking models
- High-frequency scalping

**Additional Mandatory Requirements**
- Research Analyst (RA) registration
- Detailed research report
- **Any logic change → Fresh registration**

<h4>Open APIs Are Effectively Banned</h4>
<p>
Generic or shared API access is no longer permitted.

</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #334155; border-radius:10px; padding:12px;">
<h4>Brokers Are the Principal Party</h4>
<p>
Regardless of who builds or hosts the algo,
<strong>the broker owns full responsibility</strong>.
</p>
</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #334155; border-radius:10px; padding:12px;">
<h4>Mandatory Kill Switch</h4>
<p>
Exchanges can <strong>unilaterally disable any Algo ID</strong>.
Correct Algo ID tagging is <strong>mission critical</strong>.
</p>
</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #334155; border-radius:10px; padding:12px;">
<h4>Daily API Logout & 2FA</h4>
<p>
API sessions must be logged out <strong>daily</strong> and

<h4>OPS ≤ 10 Is Not a Free Pass</h4>
<p>
≤10 OPS applies only to tech-savvy retail clients.
Orders remain algo orders and must be monitored.
</p>
</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #334155; border-radius:10px; padding:12px;">

## Who Is an Algo Provider (and How Retail Clients Differ)?

An **Algo Provider** includes:

- Fintech vendors  
- OMS / EMS providers  
- Platforms offering automated trading or execution via APIs  

> ⚠️ SEBI does not regulate algo providers directly  
> ✅ Exchanges mandate **empanelment**

Only **empanelled providers** are allowed to work with brokers.

A **Retail Client** includes individuals using **Client Direct APIs**, including **tech-savvy retail traders** running their own automation.

- **OPS ≤ 10** → Treated as algo orders but **registration exempt** (tech-savvy retail only; generic Algo ID required)  
- **OPS > 10** → **Exchange registration mandatory** with a unique Algo ID  

All automated API orders remain **algorithmic orders** and are monitored by the broker.
